    <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>:  This is a research study on the robustness of the human vision system.  You will first be given a set of “training” images where you will try to associate patterns in the images to their labels, and then will be asked to label a series of new images.  The responses and response times are the only data recorded.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>PAYMENTS & TIME INVOLVEMENT</strong>:  Your participation can take anywhere from 10 minutes to 3 hours depending on how much time you spend observing the "training" images, and the time you spend on labelling new images. More time spent will usually lead to better accuracy of labelling. To account for this, we will give performance based bonus. You will receive $3 as the base amount for completing this task. The task is in two parts. If your accuracy in part 1 is P1, your part 1 bonus will be $350(P1-0.45)<sup>3</sup> + 75(P1 - 0.45), or $0, whichever is higher. If your accuracy in part 2 is P2, your part 2 bonus will be $ 20(P2 - 0.45), or $0, whichever is higher. The figures below show how the bonus in two parts vary with accuracy. For reference, by spending about 2 hours 30 minutes on the whole task, we were able to get 80% accuracy in part 1, and about 99% accuracy in part 2. This would have amounted to $41.25 bonus for part 1, $1.8 bonus for part 2, along with $3 as base amount for completing the task.
